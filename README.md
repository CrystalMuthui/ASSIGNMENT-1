# ASSIGNMENT-1
 Abstract class, concrete class and interface.
 An abstract class has both implemented and unimplemented methods. It is declared with an abstract keyword. Contains a constructor(used to initialize final objects)

 
 A concrete class is a fully functional class. It can directly create objects and uses its methods directly. Contains implemented methods.


 An interface defines methods without implementation.It can contain abstract methods. It starts with the interface keyword. Cannot create objects.


 NB: Interface is preffered over an Abstract class because it is more flexible and can support multiple inheritance. Meaning it can inherit from multiple sources.
